# Fonts

I am in love with **NERD** fonts [link](https://www.nerdfonts.com/)

- [ ] NERD fonts (
   - JetBrains Mono 
   - OpenDyslexic for reading
   - Iosevka (retro enough **with** ligatures)
   - Monoid (retro enough **with** ligatures)
   - GoHuFont (retro **no** ligatures)
       )

But when I download them in folder there are to many of them.

## Which font to picup

I remember when install them important thing is to have one not ending with **Mono**
`JetbrainsMono Nerd Font` and not ~~JetbrainsMono Nerd Font Mono~~

## Auto install script

`../scripts/install_fonts.sh`

```bash
../scripts/install_fonts.sh JetBrainsMono
../scripts/install_fonts.sh GoHuFont

```
